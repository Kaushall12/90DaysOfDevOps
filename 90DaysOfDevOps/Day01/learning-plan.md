##### 90 Days of DevOps – Personal Learning Plan (Day 01)





###### About Me : 



I am a student (MSc IT) with a strong interest in DevOps and Cloud Engineering. I already have hands-on exposure to:



Linux fundamentals for DevOps



Python for DevOps



Shell scripting for automation



I am starting this 90-day journey to convert my fundamentals into job-ready DevOps skills.







###### My Understanding of DevOps \& Cloud : 





DevOps is not just tools—it is a culture of automation, collaboration, monitoring, and continuous improvement between development and operations teams.

Cloud engineering provides scalable, reliable infrastructure that enables DevOps practices such as CI/CD, containerization, and high availability.



Together, DevOps + Cloud help teams build, test, deploy, and scale applications faster and more reliably.







###### Where I Want to Reach :



By the end of 90 days, I want to confidently:



* Work with Linux, Git, Docker, CI/CD, Cloud, and Kubernetes



* Deploy applications on the cloud using DevOps best practices



* Be ready for DevOps fresher / internship / junior roles





###### 3 Core DevOps Skills I Will Build : 



1. Linux \& System Troubleshooting
   
2. CI/CD Pipelines (Git, GitHub Actions / Jenkins)
   
3. Containerization \& Orchestration (Docker + Kubernetes)
